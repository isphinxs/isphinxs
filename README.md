### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work at the intersection of science education, outreach, and program management to make positive change in the world. With experience in environmental studies, publishing, and software engineering, I enjoy shepherding both technical projects and more complex, mission-driven venturesâ€”and developing processes to make those programs more efficient and easier to manage. In grad school I was exposed to programming through ArcGIS and have been coding in my spare time ever since.
